/**
 * REAL end-to-end reachability test for a single [ServerConfig].
 *
 * v4.7 — THE PING WORKS AGAIN (and it is still 100% real).
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY v4.6 SHOWED NO PING FOR ANY CONFIG (the bug this fixes)
 *   v4.6 required TWO successes on TWO DISTINCT censored endpoints inside a
 *   9-second total budget with 4s per probe. On Iran's high-RTT links the first
 *   endpoint alone can eat 3-4s; a second full round-trip through a SECOND
 *   throwaway Xray core simply never fit the budget — so EVERY config, even a
 *   perfectly working one, came back "unreachable". On top of that the native
 *   `measureOutboundDelay` call is a BLOCKING JNI call that ignores coroutine
 *   cancellation, so the per-probe timeout silently didn't fire and one hung
 *   probe stalled the whole sweep.
 *
 * THE v4.7 RULE (real ping, no Google, realistic for Iran):
 *   • DO NOT test against Google — it is open everywhere and proves nothing.
 *     Every probe endpoint is a genuinely FILTERED target (Cloudflare edge,
 *     Telegram, Instagram) that only a working anti-censorship tunnel reaches.
 *   • ONE confirmed round-trip through the real outbound to a censored endpoint
 *     IS a real, honest ping — it is the same thing v2rayNG shows. We take the
 *     FIRST endpoint that answers and report ITS latency (a real measured
 *     round-trip, never a fake or random number).
 *   • The probe is made truly cancellable: the blocking native call runs in an
 *     `async` job that we await WITH a timeout, so a hung native probe can no
 *     longer freeze the sweep — we abandon it and move on.
 *
 * The probe always travels THROUGH the Xray outbound built by
 * [XrayConfigBuilder.buildPingConfig] — the SAME outbound + stream settings the
 * live connect path uses — so it reflects the real tunnel on any network
 * (Wi-Fi / mobile data / any ISP), never the local link.
 *
 * Returns the measured latency in ms, or [UNREACHABLE] (-1) if the server
 * cannot reach any censored endpoint.
