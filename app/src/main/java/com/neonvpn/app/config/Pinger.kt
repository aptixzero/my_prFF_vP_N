/**
 * REAL end-to-end reachability test for a single [ServerConfig].
 *
 * This is the heart of the "ping was lying" + "auto-test froze after a few
 * configs" fix. The ONLY thing we trust is a full proxied request that travels
 * **through the Xray outbound** to a real `generate_204` endpoint (exactly what
 * v2rayNG / v2box do). If that handshake + request succeeds, the server can
 * actually carry traffic and a real latency is returned. If it fails (or the
 * native call hangs), the server is reported UNREACHABLE.
 *
 * Why the auto-test used to freeze:
 *   `Libv2ray.measureOutboundDelay` spins up a throw-away core instance and
 *   dials the probe. On a dead / DPI-blocked node that native call could block
 *   far longer than its internal timeout (TLS retries, half-open sockets), and
 *   because every config was tested back-to-back with no upper bound, one slow
 *   node stalled the whole queue forever. We now wrap EVERY measurement in a
 *   hard [withTimeoutOrNull] ceiling so a stuck probe is abandoned and the loop
 *   marches on to the next config — the tester never gets stuck again.
 *
 * Why we don't fake it:
 *   We deliberately DO NOT fall back to a plain TCP connect against host:port —
 *   almost every config in these public lists points at a Cloudflare / Fastly
 *   front IP, so a bare TCP handshake always "succeeds" even when the proxy is
 *   dead. That false-positive is precisely why the old build showed a green ping
 *   yet opened nothing after connecting (and why v2rayNG / v2box then timed out
 *   on the very same configs). No fake pings, ever — only a genuine proxied
 *   round-trip to a live endpoint counts.
 *
 * Returns latency in ms, or [UNREACHABLE] (-1) if the server can't proxy.
